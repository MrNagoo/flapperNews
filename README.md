== README

This is the thinkster.io Rails/Angular tutorials covering flapperNews. Flapper News. Take a look at my code if you are stuck. It was a very long tutorial and it was 5 times longer because it is a terribly confusing tutorial with a bunch of broken examples and inconsistent direction. I spent more time fixing errors than working on it. Some my fault.


* Ruby version
Doesn't matter
* System dependencies
npm, bower, hombrew, node, rails.
* Configuration
If you are stuck after the `//= require angular-devise` use `//= require AngularDevise/lib/devise`

make sure on your final steps of the create method in the comments controller you add `post = Post.find(params[:post_id])` or it won't work.

* Deployment instructions
Keep learning. While it was frustrating having a broken tutorial and NO FEEDBACK whatsoever when emailing for help, it was satisfying figuring out the dumb stuff.
If thinkser.io's tactic is to give crappy tuts unless you pay money, thats not going to be a good business model. I wouldn't recommend their website.

I recommend Upcase, BLOC.io, the ODIN project, and codecademy.

Thanks.
